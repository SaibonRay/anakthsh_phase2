As such it complements and supports the pillars on efficient and sustainable transport means and operations. The required integration and enhancement of the European transport infrastructure networks needs a shift towards next levels of governance capabilities that can adequately address the key societal challenges. In the framework of this CSA on a life cycle based asset management approach for transport infrastructure networks, these challenges are related to: An unprecedented call for network capacity and performance An unprecedented call for transparent, coherent and consistent decision making on cost-performance The (mostly public) financing of the transport infrastructure system has met with concrete fiscal limits. Already in many countries in the EU, this has led to a backlog in maintenance and replacement. Unless decisive actions are taken on network construction, maintenance and operations, this trend will result in mounting congestion losses in the economic powerhouses on the short term and to prohibitive obstructions in transport flows across the European transport network on the medium term.

In particular, the processes of the formation of collective national identities and cultures as well as the process of the formation of the middle class with its emphasis on the individual’s identity are implicitly depicted, performed and negotiated in travel writing of the period. The growing popularity of travel writing at the time underlines its increased social and political importance. Furthermore, the socio-political functions of the genre are displayed in its changed form and content: from the late 18th century, travel writing increasingly changes from scientific reports to more entertaining literary forms. What is more, the particular features of the genre with regard to form and content (such as the oscillation between fact and fiction, inter- and meta-textuality and multilingualism) correspond to its multiple functions. It is my main objective to analyse the performative character of travel writing with regard to its social and political importance during the transition period from the late 18th to the middle of the 19th century.

Q01,27,211640,"Global mobility of employees: Promoting labour mobility across Europe is a central objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy and it aims to tackle increasing labour and skill shortages in the EU. Cross-border labour mobility is expected to benefit both individual citizens, employers and the aggregate economy. In addition, intra-EU mobility is a means to foster European integration. Although migration into OECD countries increases, driven largely by people moving within the EU, migration into and within Europe is still short of target levels. Despite a favourable legal framework for mobility, migrants still face a wide range of problems and obstacles that hamper cross-border labour mobility. Employment prospects for immigrants are below those of natives and overqualification, i.e. employment below skill levels, is widespread in most European countries. Consequently, the growth potential of immigrants is far from realised.

The future challenge of transport sector is to combine all urban transport modes (metro, bus, train) on a single ticket facilitating transfer between them and to enable ‘pay per use’ approach offering novel pricing model to passengers. Until now, the only two systems enabling users to pay with Smartphones are based on Quick Response (QR) code and Near Field Communications (NFC) technology. However, none of them can be adopted as mobile eticketing system applicable on a wider scale in Europe; QR code pose serious security risks and NFC suffer with lack of interoperability, limited versatility and is not supported by Apple (iOS), the landmark for mobile technology trends. The overall objective of the project is to provide novel eticketing based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. This new approach represents a real break-through in eticketing systems due to their low cost, low consumption, ultra rapid connection, improved coverage and interoperability of operators and platforms.

More than 1 million people arrived by boats in 2015 and more than 230,000 people in the first six months of 2016. PASS aims to assess the complicated field of discourses and practices of regulating migration flows into the EU, focusing on its socio-spatial impact since 2013, when the last Dublin II Regulation was promulgated (No. 604/2013). On the one hand, the project analyses the very complex stratification of geographical spaces and procedures shaped by the EU and by different national legislation. On the other hand, the research also explores the interaction between the policies and procedures plan and experiences of migrants themselves, often characterized by tensions, resistance and clashes. After a preliminary analysis of EU immigration and asylum law, the project examines the cases of Italy and of the Netherlands. Italy is one of the countries which has seen the highest number of migrants arriving and from where 39,600 asylum applicants are to be relocated under the two EU Council Decisions on relocation to other Member States under a quota system.

This is notoriously hard to observe, since sensors providing abundant and detailed information about key variables characterising this behaviour have not been available until very recently. The behaviour is also far more complex than that of the much better understood fast mode. This is due to the many degrees of freedom in decision-making, the interactions among slow traffic participants that are more involved and far less guided by traffic rules and regulations than those between car-drivers, and the many fascinating but complex phenomena in slow traffic flows (self-organised patterns, turbulence, spontaneous phase transitions, herding, etc.) that are very hard to predict accurately. With slow traffic modes gaining ground in terms of mode share in many cities, lack of empirical insights, behavioural theories, predictively valid analytical and simulation models, and tools to support planning, design, management and control is posing a major societal problem as well: examples of major accidents due to bad planning, organisation and management of events are manifold, as are locations where safety of slow modes is a serious issue due to interactions with fast modes"

Q04,1,214253,"Polyglot and Hybrid Persistence Architectures for Big Data Analytics: The need for levels of availability and scalability beyond those supported by relational databases has led to the emergence of a new generation of purpose-specific databases grouped under the term NoSQL. In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.

Q04,2,207381,"A Rigorous Approach to Consistency in Cloud Databases: Modern Internet services store data in novel cloud databases, which partition and replicate the data across a large number of machines and a wide geographical span. To achieve high availability and scalability, cloud databases need to maximise the parallelism of data processing. Unfortunately, this leads them to weaken the guarantees they provide about data consistency to applications. The resulting programming models are very challenging to use correctly, and we currently do not have advanced methods and tools that would help programmers in this task. The goal of the project is to develop a synergy of novel reasoning methods, static analysis tools and database implementation techniques that maximally exploit parallelism inside cloud databases, while enabling application programmers to ensure correctness. We intend to achieve this by first developing methods for reasoning formally about how weakening the consistency guarantees provided by cloud databases affects application correctness and the parallelism allowed inside the databases. This will build on techniques from the areas of programming languages and software verification. The resulting theory will then serve as a basis for practical implementation techniques and tools that harness database parallelism, but only to the extent such that its side effects do not compromise application correctness.

Today’s technology falls severely short for such needs due to the lack of support of complex analytics with scale, low latency, and strong guarantees of user performance requirements. To bridge the gap, this proposal tackles a grand challenge: “How do we design an algorithmic foundation that enables the development of all necessary pillars of big and fast data analysis?” This proposal considers three pillars: 1) Parallelism: There is a fundamental tension between data parallelism (for scale) and pipeline parallelism (for low latency). We propose new approaches based on intelligent use of memory and workload properties to integrate both forms of parallelism. 2) Analytics: The literature lacks a large body of algorithms for critical order-related analytics to be run under data and pipeline parallelism.

A number of time-critical applications deployed in the cloud infrastructure have to provide high reliability and throughput, along with guaranteed low latency for delivering data. This low latency guarantee is sorely lacking today, with the so-called tail-latency of slowest responses in popular cloud services being several orders of magnitude longer than the median response times. Unfortunately, simply using a network with ample bandwidth does not guarantee low latency because of problems with congestion at the intra-and inter-data center levels and server overloads. All of these problems currently render the existing cloud infrastructures unsuitable for time-critical societal applications. The reasons for unpredictable delays across the Internet and within the cloud infrastructure are numerous, but some of the key culprits are: 1) slow memory subsystems limit server effectiveness, and 2) excess buffering in the Internet further limits correlation of data requests.

Q04,22,210107,"PROVENTA Smart Database Transformation Framework: The execution of database migrations traditionally involves costs and risks that are difficult to evaluate previously. 40% of all migrations fail or exceed their budget and schedules. This prevents many organizations from implementing necessary changes to integrate better technologies, resulting in an extremely negative effect on their competitiveness in the long term. Major database vendors offer database migration tools to facilitate the adoption of their newest products, however, these tools focus only on database transformations to the vendor’s products and are only commercialized attached to the vendor package, which reinforces the vendor lock-in. Furthermore, migration tools focus on minimizing the impact of the migration process, without taking appropriate actions to avoid post-migration operational risks. At Proventa, we have gradually developed a series of custom utilities, based on commercial Open Source software, specifically for the purpose of database transformations. These tools have been progressively bundled into one single standalone package, called Datatrans. Datatrans constitutes a revolutionary standalone framework that drastically facilitates the transformation process for all the major database management systems. By releasing Datatrans as a commercial product, we will minimize migration project risks and encourage database transformations towards state-of-the art Open Source across all industries.

Q05,38,214640,"Port IoT for Environmental Leverage: Ports are a great example of heterogeneous information hubs. Multiple stakeholders operate inside and outside them with different motivations and businesses. Although document and data interchange is already in place through Port Community Systems (PCS), the interchange is limited to official documentation and services of the Port Authority, such as custom declarations, import/export of cargo, and other formal documents. However, an effective integration of operational data is far from optimal in most ports, and especially so in medium or small ports, where budget is limited and IT services usually is outsourced. In contrast, the available operational data (resources tracking, container status, vessel operations, surface or berth available, air/water quality measurements,...) is constantly increasing and technology is getting inexpensive and widely available. However, the application of such systems is still single-entity centric, since the information is not shared, keeping the real potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 hidden. The same holds for geographic areas surrounding ports, where Smart Cities integrate various data systems and provide valuable services to citizens and authorities. PIXEL will enable a two-way collaboration of ports, multimodal transport agents and cities for optimal use of internal and external resources, sustainable economic growth and environmental impact mitigation, towards the Ports of the Future.

Q06,1,210133,"End-to-End Approach for Mobility-as-a-Service tools, business models, enabling framework and evidence for European seamless mobility: With the projected growth in transport demand, the current modus operandi in transport supply is deemed unsustainable and generates the need for innovative services that could support seamless mobility and a shift from car-ownership to usership. An emerging trend towards this direction is the integration of on-demand modes in conjunction with public transport, leading to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) concept. MaaS is a user-centric, intelligent mobility distribution model, in which users' needs are met via a single platform and are offered by a service provider, the mobility operator. Although activities in this field are ongoing, at present there are no established frameworks and quantifiable evidence about MaaS costs and benefits, users’ needs, as well as its influence on travel patterns and car ownership of various user groups. Against this background the main goal of MaaS4EU is to provide quantifiable evidence, frameworks and tools, to remove the barriers and enable a cooperative and interconnected EU single transport market for the MaaS concept, by addressing challenges at 4 levels, (1) business, (2) end-users, (3) technology and (4) policy.

Q06,18,211755,"SIADE SaaS: Spatial Decision Support System for Transportation Planning: The demand for passenger transport will grow 51% by 2050, triggering a market growth to €100.6 billion by 2019. Smart Mobility enabled by Smart Public transport is key for cities’ economy and development. Worldwide transport operators are implementing AFCs (Automated Fare Collection) for a better urban transportation experience, generating Big Data, but lacking passenger destination information. However, turning these data into knowledge is challenged by the difficulty to accurately describe transport network states and computational burden coming from processing Big Spatial Data to derive metrics of capacity utilization, punctuality, passenger volumes at stops, or travel patterns of different user groups. SIADE SaaS is a spatial decision support system for bus transportation planning and other transportation systems where user destination is unknown. It delivers the most complete and accurate OD matrix in the transport industry using GIS and AFCs data.

Q06,19,193380,"Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility: Transportation sector undergoes a considerable transformation as it enters a new landscape where connectivity is seamless and mobility options and related business models are constantly increasing. Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system. OPTIMUM will establish a largely scalable, distributed architecture for the management and processing of multisource big-data, enabling continuous monitoring of transportation systems needs and proposing proactive decisions and actions in an (semi-) automatic way.

Q06,21,199138,"Automated Urban Parking and Driving: Automation of individual transport systems is considered an up-and-coming prospect with the potential of greatly mitigating many of the challenges associated with intensified urbanization, while at the same time offering additional benefits for the citizens and drastically increasing overall street safety. However, due to the lack of maturity of involved key technologies and persisting legal limitations, full automation of on-road driving remains a longer-term vision, particularly in urban environments. The goal and ambition of UP-Drive is to address these technological challenges through the development of an automated valet parking service for city environments, aimed at relieving a car driver from the burden of finding a parking space in city centers. Instead, the fully automated car navigates on its own through urban neighborhoods, finds a parking space and returns on-demand. Creating such a system requires mastering all key technologies essential to automated urban driving beyond the current state-of-the-art: complete round-view perception of the vehicle environment, robust lifelong localization and mapping, sophisticated understanding of complex scenes as well as aggregation and integration of long-term semantic data over a cloud-based infrastructure.

In fact, between 2010 and 2015, road freight transport increased by 8,1 % (measured in tonne-kilometres) and road passenger transport around 3,5% (measured in passengers per kilometre - pkm). This growth has lead into an increasing congestion of road infrastructure and rising energy consumption, which means economic, environmental and social problems. Bus and coach are the direct alternative to the car, as their infrastructure allows greater accessibility than other collective ways of transport (such as train or plane) and it offers safety and environmental advantages over other ways of transport. However, in a context in which passenger transport (in terms of pkm) has grown more than 20% between 1995 and 2015, the use of bus and coach has only increased by 4,5% during this period. The reason behind these figures lays on how each way of transport has improved the quality of their service for passengers.

From a hardware standpoint, the RF wireless transceivers of IoT devices demand the highest possible energy efficiency and a small area to enable inexpensive large-scale integration. Since analog/RF building blocks must be integrated with the mainstream digital technology, new circuit topologies and techniques must be adopted. The time-mode signaling, recently exploited in all-digital PLLs, data converters (the so called time-mode or VCO-based ADCs), opamps and filters, allows the performance of “analog” circuits to improve with the technology scaling. The proposed research focuses on a novel architecture of time-mode ADC, attempting to mitigate the fundamental limitations of such class of converters (i.e. the highly nonlinear VCO) by exploiting advanced RF techniques, thus giving rise to a hybrid time/frequency-mode operation.

This paradigm shift brings new security challenges and unfortunately many current security solutions are not applicable anymore, e.g., because of a lack of clear network boundaries or resource-constrained devices. However, security plays a central role: In addition to its classical function in protecting against manipulation and fraud, it also enables novel applications and innovative business models. We propose a research program that leverages binary analysis techniques to improve the security within the IoT. We concentrate on the software level since this enables us to both analyze a given device for potential security vulnerabilities and add security features to harden the device against future attacks. More specifically, we concentrate on the firmware (i.e., the combination of persistent memory together with program code and data that powers such devices) and develop novel mechanism for binary analysis of such software. We design an intermediate language to abstract away from the concrete assembly level and this enables an analysis of many different platforms within a unified analysis framework.

VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.

Q07,32,194193,"A New, Evolutive API and Transport-Layer Architecture for the Internet: At the 2011 OECD High-Level Meeting “The Internet Economy: Generating Innovation and Growth”, Vint Cerf, VP and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said that one of the biggest issues with the Internet is “keeping the network as open as possible to invite as much innovation as we can with as little barrier to that innovation as possible, so that new Googles and Amazons and PayPals and Skypes can happen all around the world.” A significant barrier to innovation by SMEs is the ossification of the Internet transport architecture. New groundbreaking services often require different transport protocols, better signalling between application and network, or a more flexible choice of links. A few large enterprises have the resources to support their innovations by developing their own transport systems—Adobe, Google and Microsoft have done so. Open sophisticated transport protocols exist now, but are difficult for SMEs to use owing to their lack of support across the Internet. NEAT addresses two obstacles to Internet innovation: 1) It lowers the barrier to service innovation by developing a free open-source transport system that will allow SMEs to leverage the rich set of available transport protocols. 2) It paves the way for an architectural change of the Internet where new transport layer services can seamlessly be integrated and quickly made available, minimising deployment difficulties, and allowing Internet innovators to take advantage of them where"

Q07,34,199159,"Measurement and Architecture for a Middleboxed Internet: Recent revelations about large-scale pervasive surveillance of Internet traffic have led to a rapidly expanding deployment of encryption in order to protect end-user privacy. At the same time, network operators and access providers rely on increasing use of in-network functionality provided by middleboxes and network function virtualization (NFV) approaches to improve network operations and management, and to provide additional value for their customers. In addition, new applications such as interactive video make new demands on the transport layer, requiring the deployment of new protocols and extensions, the deployment of which is impaired by the proliferation of middleboxes that cause them to fail. These three trends are on a collision course. The MAMI project seeks to restore balance among end-user privacy concerns in the face of pervasive surveillance, innovation in network protocols in the face of increasing ossification, and the provision of in-network functionality in a cooperative way. We aim to do this through the development and experimental deployment of a middlebox cooperation protocol (MCP) embedded in a more flexible transport layer, to be used together with ubiquitously deployed encryption. To ensure the applicability of the protocol, we will develop it on a background of middlebox behaviour models, derived from large"

Multiple stakeholders operate inside and outside them with different motivations and businesses. Although document and data interchange is already in place through Port Community Systems (PCS), the interchange is limited to official documentation and services of the Port Authority, such as custom declarations, import/export of cargo, and other formal documents. However, an effective integration of operational data is far from optimal in most ports, and especially so in medium or small ports, where budget is limited and IT services usually is outsourced. In contrast, the available operational data (resources tracking, container status, vessel operations, surface or berth available, air/water quality measurements,...) is constantly increasing and technology is getting inexpensive and widely available. However, the application of such systems is still single-entity centric, since the information is not shared, keeping the real potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 hidden. The same holds for geographic areas surrounding ports, where Smart Cities integrate various data systems and provide valuable services to citizens and authorities.

Today's internet is protected by a form of cryptography based on complexity theoretic hardness assumptions. Ideally, they should be strong to ensure security and versatile to offer a wide range of functionalities and allow efficient implementations. However, these assumptions are largely untested and internet security could be built on sand. The main ambition of Almacrypt is to remedy this issue by challenging the assumptions through an advanced algorithmic analysis. In particular, this proposal questions the two pillars of public-key encryption: factoring and discrete logarithms. Recently, the PI contributed to show that in some cases, the discrete logarithm problem is considerably weaker than previously assumed. A main objective is to ponder the security of other cases of the discrete logarithm problem, including elliptic curves, and of factoring. We will study the generalization of the recent techniques and search for new algorithmic options with comparable or better efficiency. We will also study hardness assumptions based on codes and subset-sum, two candidates for post-quantum cryptography. We will consider the applicability of recent algorithmic and mathematical techniques to the resolution of the corresponding putative hard problems, refine the analysis of the algorithms and design new algorithm tools.

The performance of ICs in terms of integration density, power consumption and cost, in fact, is the only limiting factor to the feasibility and/or to the widespread diffusion of IoT-based solutions. Digital ICs in the most recent nanoscale CMOS technologies are keeping the pace of IoT requirements. On the contrary, the implementation of analog functions, which are however essential to acquire data from sensors, thus enabling the interactions of IoT nodes with the surrounding environment, is nowadays the real bottleneck and the most serious concern and limiting factor for the further development of IoT applications. In the foreseeable future, the planned device scaling and voltage reduction down to near threshold (e.g. 0.4-0.5V) makes the design of analog circuits extremely hard, in view of the degradation of signal-to-noise ratio, matching and linearity.

Q07,45,200038,"Securing Internet Routing from the Ground Up: The Internet is made up of dozens of thousands of smaller networks, called Autonomous Systems (ASes), ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses and schools, e.g., Google, Deutsche Telekom, AT&amp;T, and Hebrew U. Routing between ASes is handled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is the glue that holds the Internet together. Alarmingly, despite the Internet's critical societal and economic role, BGP routing is dangerously vulnerable to configuration errors and attacks, and, consequently, every year or so a major Internet outage makes the news. To remedy BGP’s many security vulnerabilities, researchers and practitioners have invested much effort into designing security solutions for BGP routing. Yet, despite over a decade of Herculean efforts, many technological, political, and economic hurdles hinder, and possibly even prevent, deployment. I argue that the reasons for this are deeply rooted in today’s centralized, top-down, hierarchical paradigm for securing Internet routing. The aim of the planned research project is to put forth and explore a radically new paradigm for securing routing on the Internet.

Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes.

Leveraging Big Data to Manage Transport Operations (LeMO) project will explore the implications of the utilisation of big data to enhance the economic sustainability and competitiveness of European transport sector. The project will study and analyse big data in the European transport domain in particular with respect to five transport dimensions: mode, sector, technology, policy and evaluation. LeMO will accomplish this by conducting a series of case studies, in order to provide recommendations on the prerequisites of effective big data implementation in the transport field. Through case studies, LeMO will investigate methodological, technological, governmental and institutional issues, which in turn contribute to evidence-based decision making. LeMO will supplement these case studies with a horizontal analysis that identifies the barriers and limitations of the transportation system to exploit big data opportunities.

Q08,46,211640,"Global mobility of employees: Promoting labour mobility across Europe is a central objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy and it aims to tackle increasing labour and skill shortages in the EU. Cross-border labour mobility is expected to benefit both individual citizens, employers and the aggregate economy. In addition, intra-EU mobility is a means to foster European integration. Although migration into OECD countries increases, driven largely by people moving within the EU, migration into and within Europe is still short of target levels. Despite a favourable legal framework for mobility, migrants still face a wide range of problems and obstacles that hamper cross-border labour mobility. Employment prospects for immigrants are below those of natives and overqualification, i.e. employment below skill levels, is widespread in most European countries. Consequently, the growth potential of immigrants is far from realised. Little is known about transnational mobility patterns and the length of migration episodes as well as about retention processes of foreign employees. There is considerable scope to make existing labour mobility more efficient and beneficial for all parties involved.

But the increased concentration of power on the internet in the hands of just a few ever more dominant players makes that few now reap the true benefits of the digital economy; the growing complexity and opacity of the processes and technologies that govern it makes challenging this status quo exceedingly difficult. Serious interventions are needed to make the next generation internet inclusive, resilient and competitive again. By intervening in the development process of emerging technologies, we are able to steer the process of innovation in a human-centric and ethical direction and allow European businesses and civil society organisations to play a leading and pioneering role in their development. But to help direct and shape the future internet, we need to know which technologies will underpin it. To identify the technologies that will likely be game changers for the internet in 2025, we use cutting edge big data methodologies and novel web-scraped data sources to capture early signals about technologies and research topics, and develop a rigorous process for evaluating whether a technology will positively contribute to the development of a more desirable internet.

Wireless data traffic is predicted to increase by almost three orders of magnitude in the next five years. It is unlikely that such increase can be tackled by an incremental “more-of-the-same” approach. This proposal stems from the observation that the killer application for wireless networks is on-demand access to Internet content. CARENET advocates a novel content-aware approach to wireless networks design that can provably solve the scalability problem of current systems, thus supporting the paradigmatic shift “from Gigabits per second for a few to Terabytes per month for all”. CARENET’s vision is to serve an arbitrarily large number of users with bounded transmission resources (bandwidth, number of transmit antennas, and power). The fundamental question is: how can such a per-user throughput scalability be achieved in the presence of on-demand requests, for which users do not access simultaneously the same content? CARENET builds on a novel information theoretic formulation of content-aware networks and on several recent results in information theory, network coding, channel coding, and protocol design, stimulated by the PI’s recent work. Key elements of the proposed content-aware architectures are new caching"

Their design must make possible the provision of real-time high-bandwidth access to Internet, essential for advanced communication services as immersive video and ubiquitous cloud computing. It is clearly foreseen that the only long-term solution to the problem involves optical fiber as transmission medium, the so called optical access networks. Passive optical network (PON) is the most widely employed technology because of the cost reduction it entails, but the capacity of actual time-division multiplexed PONs will be exhausted eventually as more bandwidth-hungry applications become available in the near future. Telecommunications carriers face the challenge of meeting the unprecedented bandwidth demand by end users at the same time the capital and operating expenditures requirements are reduced.

New groundbreaking services often require different transport protocols, better signalling between application and network, or a more flexible choice of links. A few large enterprises have the resources to support their innovations by developing their own transport systems—Adobe, Google and Microsoft have done so. Open sophisticated transport protocols exist now, but are difficult for SMEs to use owing to their lack of support across the Internet. NEAT addresses two obstacles to Internet innovation: 1) It lowers the barrier to service innovation by developing a free open-source transport system that will allow SMEs to leverage the rich set of available transport protocols. 2) It paves the way for an architectural change of the Internet where new transport layer services can seamlessly be integrated and quickly made available, minimising deployment difficulties, and allowing Internet innovators to take advantage of them where"

However, their active participation in society is not reflected sufficiently in policy and decision-making, especially in relation to digital issues. Because of this, they are not well represented and unheard, and this makes it hard for research and policy to identify and understand their needs. These issues are further complicated by the fact that the group is a swiftly moving target, it is as heterogeneous as the wider society, and young people can be unwilling to be subjects of research.

At the same time, network operators and access providers rely on increasing use of in-network functionality provided by middleboxes and network function virtualization (NFV) approaches to improve network operations and management, and to provide additional value for their customers. In addition, new applications such as interactive video make new demands on the transport layer, requiring the deployment of new protocols and extensions, the deployment of which is impaired by the proliferation of middleboxes that cause them to fail. These three trends are on a collision course. The MAMI project seeks to restore balance among end-user privacy concerns in the face of pervasive surveillance, innovation in network protocols in the face of increasing ossification, and the provision of in-network functionality in a cooperative way. We aim to do this through the development and experimental deployment of a middlebox cooperation protocol (MCP) embedded in a more flexible transport layer, to be used together with ubiquitously deployed encryption. To ensure the applicability of the protocol, we will develop it on a background of middlebox behaviour models, derived from large"

New requirements include the need for dynamic changes of the required resources, for example, to react to social events or to shifts of demands. Existing networks and, in particular, the Internet cannot meet those requirements mainly due to their ossification and hence limitation in resource allocation, i.e., lack of flexibility to adapt the available resources to changes of demands on a small time-scale and in an efficient way. In recent years, several concepts have emerged in networking research to provide more flexibility in networks through virtualization and control plane programmability. In particular, the split between data plane and a centralized control plane as defined by Software Defined Networking (SDN) is regarded as the basic concept to allow flexibility in networks. However, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means remains open. In this project, flexibility focuses on the dynamic changes in time and size of a network that is characterized by its resources (link rate and node capacities) and connectivity (network graph). It is the objective of this research to analyse the fundamental design space for flexibility in SDN-based networks with respect to cost such as resource usage, traffic overhead and delay.

This paradigm shift brings new security challenges and unfortunately many current security solutions are not applicable anymore, e.g., because of a lack of clear network boundaries or resource-constrained devices. However, security plays a central role: In addition to its classical function in protecting against manipulation and fraud, it also enables novel applications and innovative business models. We propose a research program that leverages binary analysis techniques to improve the security within the IoT. We concentrate on the software level since this enables us to both analyze a given device for potential security vulnerabilities and add security features to harden the device against future attacks. More specifically, we concentrate on the firmware (i.e., the combination of persistent memory together with program code and data that powers such devices) and develop novel mechanism for binary analysis of such software. We design an intermediate language to abstract away from the concrete assembly level and this enables an analysis of many different platforms within a unified analysis framework.

Routing between ASes is handled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is the glue that holds the Internet together. Alarmingly, despite the Internet's critical societal and economic role, BGP routing is dangerously vulnerable to configuration errors and attacks, and, consequently, every year or so a major Internet outage makes the news. To remedy BGP’s many security vulnerabilities, researchers and practitioners have invested much effort into designing security solutions for BGP routing. Yet, despite over a decade of Herculean efforts, many technological, political, and economic hurdles hinder, and possibly even prevent, deployment. I argue that the reasons for this are deeply rooted in today’s centralized, top-down, hierarchical paradigm for securing Internet routing.

Recent years saw the growth of a new software ecosystem -Software-defined networking (SDN)- which advocates a clean and open interface between networking devices and the software that controls them. Yet, existing SDN languages do not support reasoning about crucial quantitative aspects, such as: ""How much congestion is there?"" or ""Is the network resilient under failure?"".

There are currently no guarantees that deployed networks correctly implement their operator’s policy. Existing research has focused on two directions: a) low level analysis and instrumentation of real networking code prevents memory bugs in individual network elements, but does not capture network-wide properties desired by operators such as reachability or loop freedom; b) high-level analysis of network-wide properties to verify operator policies on abstract network models; unfortunately, there are no guarantees that the models are an accurate representation of the real network code, and often low-level errors invalidate the conclusions of the high-level analysis. We propose to achieve provably correct networks by simultaneously targeting both low-level security concerns and network-wide policy compliance checking. Our key proposal is to rely on exhaustive network symbolic execution for verification and to automatically generate provably correct implementations from network models.

In this context, the main objective of network operators and service providers is to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users by providing high quality services and mechanisms for seamless adaptation to the specific network conditions of each user. However, the initial design of the Internet as a best-effort network makes it inappropriate for high-volume and bandwidth-intensive applications, like video streaming, and the centralised architectures employed by the network operators lead to long, non-optimal communication paths between clients and servers, waste of network resources and increased delays.

Using Sen's Capabilities Approach, it will conceptualise data justice along three dimensions of freedoms: (in)visibility, digital (dis)engagement, and nondiscrimination. Multi-sited ethnography in combination with digital methods will be used to build a conceptual framework, which will then be tested"
Q10,33,212798,"The Disrupted Society: mapping the societal effects of blockchain technology diffusion: Recent advances in cryptography yielded the blockchain technology, which enables a radically new and decentralized method to maintain authoritative records, without the need of trusted intermediaries. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency blockchain application has already demonstrated that it is possible to operate a purely cryptography-based, global, distributed, decentralized, anonymous financial network, independent from central and commercial banks, regulators and the state. The same technology is now being applied to other social domains (e.g. public registries of ownership and deeds, voting systems, the internet domain name registry). But research on the societal impact of blockchain innovation is scant, and we cannot properly assess its risks and promises. In addition, crucial knowledge is missing on how blockchain technologies can and should be regulated by law. The BlockchainSociety project focuses on three research questions. (1) What internal factors contribute to the success of a blockchain application? (2) How does society adopt blockchain? (3) How to regulate blockchain? It breaks new ground as it (1) maps the most important blockchain projects, their governance, and assesses their disruptive potential; (2) documents and analyses the social diffusion of the technology, and builds scenarios about the potential impact of blockchain diffusion; and (3) it creates an inventory of emerging policy responses, compares and assesses policy tools in terms"
Q10,34,200044,"SOcietal Needs aNalysis and Emerging Technologies in the public Sector: It is a fact that technology in our age is offering countless solutions that could change the way we live and act and that innovation is lately directly linked with emerging technologies that are applied in various domains. However, despite the investments performed in the last decade the bitter truth is that “we are not there yet” when it comes to fully exploiting the benefits of ICT to help the public sector to meet emerging societal needs. SONNETS will tackle this issue of empowering the public sector in becoming a core innovation driver by dedicating itself to the following core questions: • How to identify, monitor and early detect societal trends that need to be met by specific public sector services? • How to timely get aware of emerging technologies and assess their usability for the public sector? To provide convincing answers to these questions SONNETS will deliver an innovative methodological framework to accelerate the transformation of the public sector through the identification and analysis of emerging technologies that hold the potential to transform the public sector into a technology leader and innovation carrier. Thus SONNETS has committed itself to the mission to foster collaboration between all relevant stakeholders by breaking down knowledge silos towards building a more productive, responsive and innovation generating public sector. As such SONNETS is based on the following sub-concepts, which can be witnessed as a quadruple helix: •"
Q10,35,200391,"Building an IoT OPen innovation Ecosystem for connected smart objects: The Internet of Things (IoT) brings opportunities for creating new services and products, reducing costs for societies, increasing the service level for the citizens in a number of areas, and changing how services are sold and consumed. Despite these opportunities, current information system architectures create obstacles that must be addressed for leveraging the full potential of IoT. One of the most critical obstacles are the ‘vertical silos’ that shape today’s IoT because they constitute a serious impediment to the creation of cross-domain, cross-platform and cross-organisational applications and services. Those silos also hamper developers from producing new added value across multiple platforms due to the lack of interoperability and openness. bIoTope provides the necessary Standardized Open APIs for enabling horizontal interoperability between silos. Such horizontal interoperability makes it possible to develop Systems of Systems where cross-domain information from platforms, devices and other information sources can be accessed when and as needed. bIoTope-enabled Systems can seamlessly exploit all available information, which makes them smart in the sense that they can take or propose the most appropriate actions depending on the current User’s or Object’s Context/Situation, and even learn from experience. bIoTope capabilities lay the foundation for open innovation ecosystems where companies can innovate both by the creation"

With the threat of geopolitical instability coming from several dimensions Europe needs to not just assert its presence on the world stage, but moreover needs to assert its digital sovereignty to further its vision of a single digital market. The need for a European leadership role for the Next Generation Internet is clear. NGI MOVE is to inspire Europe to become a leader in the co-creation of the NGI in a more human centric, societal and economic beneficial ecosystem of researchers, high tech start-ups, industrial and government leaders as well as grassroots communities and individuals. The vision is to create a NGI that is at the service of people and stimulates business opportunities, centred on European values and competing globally. Our message is pragmatic cybernetics, balancing extreme centralisation and extreme decentralization where data stays with citizens. The main activities of the project are driven by the following activities: Connecting the Next Generation Internet Ecosystem is the primary activity, in that it identifies and engages with the most brilliant researchers, entrepreneurs and individuals. Co-creating the Next Generation Internet Ecosystem is all about creating content that fuels the community and motivates people to engage.

Τo address the limitations of the current D-RAN and C-RAN approaches, 5G-PICTURE will exploit flexible functional splits that can be dynamically selected, to optimise resource and energy efficiency. This results in a paradigm shift, from RAN and C-RAN to Dis-Aggregated RANʼ (DA-RAN). DA-RAN is a novel concept where HW and SW components are disaggregated across the wireless, optical and compute/storage domains. Resource disaggregationʼ allows decoupling these components, creating a common “pool of resources” that can be independently selected and allocated on demand to compose any infrastructure service.

The extension of the Internet to the physical spaces and objects is a massive opportunity for new services and business for example in the areas of logistics, transport, environment, security and wellbeing. Internet of everything is directly linked to the smart city development, but it has proceeded slower than expected. The key showstoppers are the lack of common standards, fragmented marketplace, and lack of ways to systematically test and introduce new solutions in the cities. The common challenge of the SELECT for Cities PCP is the design, research and development of “cities as linked and large-scale Internet of Everything labs”. The challenge lies in developing an open, standardized, data-driven, service-oriented and user-centric platform that enables large-scale co-creation, testing and validation of urban IoE applications and services. This approach fosters the longer-term goal of evidence-based innovation in cities.

Q10,39,213405,"Platform Labor: Digital transformations of work and livelihood in post-welfare societies: Digital platforms like Uber and Airbnb are transforming how people work, create and share value, and sustain themselves in their everyday lives. As such, platforms are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as new institutional actors that redraw relations between civil society, the market, and the state. Yet, as many scholars have shown, such relations have historically been shaped by pervasive gender, class, and racial subordination. It is therefore crucial to ask to what extent platforms, as new sites of capital accumulation, governance, and norm-making, remediate existing inequalities and if/how they also generate new vulnerabilities or tools for empowerment. Accordingly, this research project aims to determine how digital platforms are reconfiguring the gendered, classed, and racialized organization of labor and social reproduction in post-welfare societies. To achieve this aim, three objectives have to be met: • determining how on-demand labor platforms distribute new opportunities and vulnerabilities for workers along gender, class, and racial lines; • determining how digital platforms create new solutions and challenges for the gendered, classed, and racialized problem of social reproduction in post-welfare societies; • determining which policy and legal issues arise when labor and social reproduction are increasingly organized through platforms and identifying ways to tackle"
Q10,40,212699,"The cost of limited communication bandwidth in distributed computing: Distributed systems underlie many modern technologies, a prime example being the Internet. The ever-increasing abundance of distributed systems necessitates their design and usage to be backed by strong theoretical foundations. A major challenge that distributed systems face is the lack of a central authority, which brings many aspects of uncertainty into the environment, in the form of unknown network topology or unpredictable dynamic behavior. A practical restriction of distributed systems, which is at the heart of this proposal, is the limited bandwidth available for communication between the network components. A central family of distributed tasks is that of local tasks, which are informally described as tasks which are possible to solve by sending information through only a relatively small number of hops. A cornerstone example is the need to break symmetry and provide a better utilization of resources, which can be obtained by the task of producing a valid coloring of the nodes given some small number of colors. Amazingly, there are still huge gaps between the known upper and lower bounds for the complexity of many local tasks. This holds even if one allows powerful assumptions of unlimited bandwidth. While some known algorithms indeed use small messages, the complexity gaps are even larger compared to the unlimited bandwidth case. This is not a mere coincidence, and in fact the existing theoretical infrastructure is provably incapable of"
Q10,41,202699,"Advanced Tools to assEss and mitigate the criticality of ICT compoNents and their dependencies over Critical InfrAstructures: Over recent years, Industrial and Automation Control Systems (IACS) adopted in Critical Infrastructures (CIs) have become more complex due to the increasing number of interconnected devices, and to the large amount of information exchanged among system components. With the emergence of such an “Internet of Things” generation of IACS, the boundaries to be protected have grown well beyond that of the single or aggregated-plant, typical of the mono-operator or silos vision. That poses new challenges, as more operators become involved in a scenario that naturally demands the introduction of multi-tenancy mechanisms. New ICT paradigms, where virtualization is playing an important role, provide innovative features for flexible and efficient management, monitoring and control of devices and data traffic. With the OT/IT convergence, OT (Operation Technologies) will benefit from IT innovation, but at the same time, they will also inherit new IT threats that can potentially impact CIs. ATENA project, with reference to the above-mentioned interdependent scenario, aims at achieving the desired level of Security and Resilience of the considered CIs, while preserving their efficient and flexible management.

Q10,43,200252,"Open virtual neighbourhood network to connect intelligent buildings and smart objects: The lack of interoperability is considered as the most important barrier to achieve the global integration of IoT ecosystems across borders of different disciplines, vendors and standards. Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries. To overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services. VICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY"
Q10,44,211570,"Data-driven decision making for a more efficient society: The rapid diffusion of digital information technologies has created an explosive growth in the amount of digital data. 90% of the world’s data today has been created in the last two years alone. The availability of this data has opened up an opportunity to create significant value on all levels of the society. More extensive use of this data for data-driven decision-making (by companies, governments, researchers) could improve European GDP by more than €120 billion by 2020. However, this opportunity is currently restricted by privacy regulations, distrust and business secrets. Sharemind is the first technology that truly enables the use of confidential data for data-driven decision-making, and thereby fundamentally enhances the potential value of big data. The novelty of Sharemind lies in its ability to extract useful information from private data without even seeing the data. Sharemind makes new types and more data available for sharing/analysis and simplifies the data analysis process, and thereby enables applications that have been impossible before. Users of Sharemind gain new insights that can be used for making decisions, improving productivity, optimising marketing, developing new products and services and implementing new business models. Sharemind has been validated in an operational environment with five piloting customers (TRL7). Our go-to-market action plan foresees approaching our existing list of interested prospects as soon as the limitations to Sharemind global scale-"
Q10,45,202642,"Architecture-driven, Multi-concern and Seamless Assurance and Certification of Cyber-Physical Systems: Embedded systems have significantly increased in technical complexity towards open, interconnected systems. This has exacerbated the problem of ensuring dependability in the presence of human, environmental and technological risks. The rise of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has led to many initiatives to promote reuse and automation of labor-intensive activities. Two large-scale projects are OPENCOSS and SafeCer, which dealt with assurance and certification of software-intensive critical systems using incremental and model-based approaches. OPENCOSS defined a Common Certification Language (CCL), unifying concepts from different industries to build a harmonized approach to reduce time and cost overheads, via facilitating the reuse of certification assets. SafeCer developed safety-oriented process lines, a component model, contract-based verification techniques, and process/product-based model-driven safety certification for compositional development and certification of CPSs. AMASS will create and consolidate a de-facto European-wide assurance and certification open tool platform, ecosystem and self-sustainable community spanning the largest CPS vertical markets.

Q10,46,215070,"Gaussian entropic inequalities and uncertainty relations for communication and secure quantum key distribution: Information and communication technologies are essential to modern society as the internet is pervading all aspects of our lives. Quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit to the communication rates. Determining this limit is one of the two challenges addressed by GENIUS. Given the amount of sensitive information sent through the internet, secure communications are essential to our society. To fulfill this need, the EU is investing in quantum key distribution (QKD) with the 1G€ Quantum Technology Flagship. The other challenge addressed by GENIUS is determining the maximum rate for secure communication that can be achieved by the forthcoming generation of QKD devices and proving their perfect security. To address the above challenges, I will firstly apply methods from functional analysis to prove new fundamental entropic inequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels provide a mathematical model for the propagation of electromagnetic signals. Entropy is the core of information theory and quantifies the information content of a system. These inequalities will determine the maximum rates allowed by quantum mechanics for communication and QKD. Secondly, I aim to propose and prove a new fundamental entropic uncertainty relation for the heterodyne measurement. This uncertainty relation will prove the perfect security of the most promising QKD protocol. These new insight"

The rise of freelancer movement together with new ways of organizing work have dramatically changed the economic landscape. In this new environment the value creation happens in global talent networks, and the potential for disruptive innovations is embedded in the dispersed, decentralized organizations and teams. New challenges resulting from this development require effective tools to enable business environment and the entire society to adapt. As a result, platform thinking is gaining momentum in the innovation management field. Various platforms and especially so called competence platforms are anticipated to dramatically boost the global economy through improved productivity and higher degree of workforce utilization. According to a recent McKinsey’s foresight, online talent platforms can boost the global GDP by USD 2,7 trillion by 2025. And this is exactly the area where Part-up is going to have global impact!

However, it suffers from 3 main challenges: (1) Infrastructure: centralized surveillance that the central hubs of information exercise over their users, (2) Governance: disempowered communities which do not have any decision-making influence over the platform, and (3) Economy: concentration of profits in a few major players who do not proportionally redistribute them to the contributors. How can CE software platforms be implemented for solving these challenges? P2PMODELS explores a new way of building CE software platforms harnessing the blockchain, an emerging technology that enables autonomous agent-mediated organizations, in order to (1) provide a software framework to build decentralized infrastructure for Collaborative Economy organizations that do not depend on central authorities, (2) enable democratic-by-design models of governance for communities, by encoding rules directly into the software platform, and (3) enable fairer value distribution models, thus improving the economic sustainability of both CE contributors and organizations. Together, these 3 objectives will bootstrap the emergence of a new generation of self-governed and more economically sustainable peer-to-peer CE communities.
