As such it complements and supports the pillars on efficient and sustainable transport means and operations. The required integration and enhancement of the European transport infrastructure networks needs a shift towards next levels of governance capabilities that can adequately address the key societal challenges. In the framework of this CSA on a life cycle based asset management approach for transport infrastructure networks, these challenges are related to: An unprecedented call for network capacity and performance An unprecedented call for transparent, coherent and consistent decision making on cost-performance The (mostly public) financing of the transport infrastructure system has met with concrete fiscal limits. Already in many countries in the EU, this has led to a backlog in maintenance and replacement. Unless decisive actions are taken on network construction, maintenance and operations, this trend will result in mounting congestion losses in the economic powerhouses on the short term and to prohibitive obstructions in transport flows across the European transport network on the medium term.

In particular, the processes of the formation of collective national identities and cultures as well as the process of the formation of the middle class with its emphasis on the individual’s identity are implicitly depicted, performed and negotiated in travel writing of the period. The growing popularity of travel writing at the time underlines its increased social and political importance. Furthermore, the socio-political functions of the genre are displayed in its changed form and content: from the late 18th century, travel writing increasingly changes from scientific reports to more entertaining literary forms. What is more, the particular features of the genre with regard to form and content (such as the oscillation between fact and fiction, inter- and meta-textuality and multilingualism) correspond to its multiple functions. It is my main objective to analyse the performative character of travel writing with regard to its social and political importance during the transition period from the late 18th to the middle of the 19th century.

Q01,27,211640,"Global mobility of employees: Promoting labour mobility across Europe is a central objective of the Europe 2020 Strategy and it aims to tackle increasing labour and skill shortages in the EU. Cross-border labour mobility is expected to benefit both individual citizens, employers and the aggregate economy. In addition, intra-EU mobility is a means to foster European integration. Although migration into OECD countries increases, driven largely by people moving within the EU, migration into and within Europe is still short of target levels. Despite a favourable legal framework for mobility, migrants still face a wide range of problems and obstacles that hamper cross-border labour mobility. Employment prospects for immigrants are below those of natives and overqualification, i.e. employment below skill levels, is widespread in most European countries. Consequently, the growth potential of immigrants is far from realised. Little is known about transnational mobility patterns and the length of migration episodes as well as about retention processes of foreign employees.

Q02,7,205926,"Transforming Cellular Network Data Into the Next Generation of Mobility Management Platform: Transportation authorities use real-time traffic data for everyday urban transport management, and analyse commuters’ origin and destination points for infrastructure and transit planning. However, intelligent transport systems that provide real-time data cost millions of euros for road sensor deployment. GPS aggregators like Google Maps and Inrix are inexpensive but can miss up to 50% of real time traffic jams, and do not represent population segments proportionally, which is essential to transportation planning. Cellular network location data is now ubiquitous and cheap, but it is imprecise due to the range of cellular antenna coverage. Cellint uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process cellular network location data for optimized transportation management. Our patented technology tracks phones on a mobile network passively and anonymously, pinpointing their locations on any mode of transportation. The result is a virtual sensor network that provides real-time sensor-quality traffic data at a fraction of the cost of sensor systems. Our origin-destination data is so accurate that it can identify the root causes of specific transit congestions. Our technology is unparalleled in its performance and cost-effectiveness.

Q04,1,214253,"Polyglot and Hybrid Persistence Architectures for Big Data Analytics: The need for levels of availability and scalability beyond those supported by relational databases has led to the emergence of a new generation of purpose-specific databases grouped under the term NoSQL. In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.

Q04,2,207381,"A Rigorous Approach to Consistency in Cloud Databases: Modern Internet services store data in novel cloud databases, which partition and replicate the data across a large number of machines and a wide geographical span. To achieve high availability and scalability, cloud databases need to maximise the parallelism of data processing. Unfortunately, this leads them to weaken the guarantees they provide about data consistency to applications. The resulting programming models are very challenging to use correctly, and we currently do not have advanced methods and tools that would help programmers in this task. The goal of the project is to develop a synergy of novel reasoning methods, static analysis tools and database implementation techniques that maximally exploit parallelism inside cloud databases, while enabling application programmers to ensure correctness. We intend to achieve this by first developing methods for reasoning formally about how weakening the consistency guarantees provided by cloud databases affects application correctness and the parallelism allowed inside the databases. This will build on techniques from the areas of programming languages and software verification. The resulting theory will then serve as a basis for practical implementation techniques and tools that harness database parallelism, but only to the extent such that its side effects do not compromise application correctness.

Q04,16,213441,"Increasing the Spatial Correlation of Logical Units of Data to Enable an Ultra-Low Latency Internet: The cloud computing infrastructure that logically centralizes data storage and computation for many different actors is a prime example of a key societal system. A number of time-critical applications deployed in the cloud infrastructure have to provide high reliability and throughput, along with guaranteed low latency for delivering data. This low latency guarantee is sorely lacking today, with the so-called tail-latency of slowest responses in popular cloud services being several orders of magnitude longer than the median response times. Unfortunately, simply using a network with ample bandwidth does not guarantee low latency because of problems with congestion at the intra-and inter-data center levels and server overloads. All of these problems currently render the existing cloud infrastructures unsuitable for time-critical societal applications. The reasons for unpredictable delays across the Internet and within the cloud infrastructure are numerous, but some of the key culprits are: 1) slow memory subsystems limit server effectiveness, and 2) excess buffering in the Internet further limits correlation of data requests. The aim of this project is to dramatically change the way data flows across the Internet, such that it is more highly correlated when it is to be processed at the servers. The overarching goal is to enforce a large"

Unlocking this potential requires sharing of (often personal) data between organizations, but this meets unwillingness from data subjects and data controllers alike. Hence, techniques that protect personal information for data access, processing, and analysis are needed. To address this, the SODA project will enable practical privacy-preserving analytics of information from multiple data assets using multi-party computation (MPC) techniques. For this data does not need to be shared, only made available for encrypted processing. The main technological challenge is to make MPC scale to big data, where we will achieve substantial performance improvements. We embed MPC into a comprehensive privacy approach, demonstrated in an ICT-14.b and a healthcare use case. Our first objective is to enable MPC for big data applications by scaling the performance. We follow a use case-driven approach, combining expertise from the domains of MPC and data analytics. Our second objective is to combine these improvements with a multidisciplinary approach towards privacy. By enabling differential privacy in the MPC setting aggregated results will not leak individual personal data.

Q04,18,212617,"INtelligeNt ApplicatiOns oVer Large ScAle DaTa StrEams: Large scale data analytics is the key research domain for future data driven applications as numerous of devices produce huge volumes of data in the form of streams. Analytics services can offer the necessary basis for building intelligent decision making mechanisms to support novel applications. Due to the huge volumes of data, analytics should be based on efficient schemes for querying large scale data partitions. Partitions contain only a piece of data and a dedicated processor manages the incoming queries. The management of continuous queries over data streams is a challenging research issue requiring intelligent methods to derive the final outcome (i.e., query response) in limited time with maximum performance. The management process of continuous queries involves their assignment to specific processors and the processing of the derived responses. We focus on a group of query controllers serving the incoming queries and, thus, becoming the connection of big data systems with the real world. INNOVATE proposes solutions for the management of the controllers behavior. We propose an intelligent decision making process for each controller in three axes: (i) top-down, by realizing a mechanism that assigns queries to the underlying processors; (ii) bottom-up, by proposing decision making mechanisms for returning responses to users/applications on top of early results; (i"

Big data are specified by their Volume, Variety, Velocity and by their Veracity/Imprecision. Based on these 4V specificities, it has become difficult to quickly acquire the most useful information from the huge amount of data at hand. Thus, it is necessary to perform data (pre-)processing as a first step. In spite of the existence of many techniques for this task, most of the state-of-the-art methods require additional information for thresholding and are neither able to deal with the big data veracity aspect nor with their computational requirements.

This prevents many organizations from implementing necessary changes to integrate better technologies, resulting in an extremely negative effect on their competitiveness in the long term. Major database vendors offer database migration tools to facilitate the adoption of their newest products, however, these tools focus only on database transformations to the vendor’s products and are only commercialized attached to the vendor package, which reinforces the vendor lock-in. Furthermore, migration tools focus on minimizing the impact of the migration process, without taking appropriate actions to avoid post-migration operational risks. At Proventa, we have gradually developed a series of custom utilities, based on commercial Open Source software, specifically for the purpose of database transformations. These tools have been progressively bundled into one single standalone package, called Datatrans. Datatrans constitutes a revolutionary standalone framework that drastically facilitates the transformation process for all the major database management systems.

One of the most critical obstacles are the ‘vertical silos’ that shape today’s IoT because they constitute a serious impediment to the creation of cross-domain, cross-platform and cross-organisational applications and services. Those silos also hamper developers from producing new added value across multiple platforms due to the lack of interoperability and openness. bIoTope provides the necessary Standardized Open APIs for enabling horizontal interoperability between silos. Such horizontal interoperability makes it possible to develop Systems of Systems where cross-domain information from platforms, devices and other information sources can be accessed when and as needed. bIoTope-enabled Systems can seamlessly exploit all available information, which makes them smart in the sense that they can take or propose the most appropriate actions depending on the current User’s or Object’s Context/Situation, and even learn from experience. bIoTope capabilities lay the foundation for open innovation ecosystems where companies can innovate both by the creation"

However, the ever-growing deployment of the visual sensing applications within IoT deployments is expected to strain the network and cloud infrastructures used to deliver and store massive amounts of visual data. To partly address these challenges, prototypes of neuromorphic visual sensors, a.k.a. dynamic vision sensors (DVS), have been produced in the last two years. Instead of the conventional raster scan of video cameras, DVS devices record pixel coordinates and timestamps of reflectance events in an asynchronous manner, thereby offering substantial improvements in sampling speed and power consumption. ENVISION argues that, in order to fully exploit the advantages of neuromorphic sensing for IoT applications, such devices should be coupled with appropriate transmission and storage mechanisms that would take advantage of the visual data properties to achieve even higher bandwidth, power and storage efficiency.

Q06,18,211755,"SIADE SaaS: Spatial Decision Support System for Transportation Planning: The demand for passenger transport will grow 51% by 2050, triggering a market growth to €100.6 billion by 2019. Smart Mobility enabled by Smart Public transport is key for cities’ economy and development. Worldwide transport operators are implementing AFCs (Automated Fare Collection) for a better urban transportation experience, generating Big Data, but lacking passenger destination information. However, turning these data into knowledge is challenged by the difficulty to accurately describe transport network states and computational burden coming from processing Big Spatial Data to derive metrics of capacity utilization, punctuality, passenger volumes at stops, or travel patterns of different user groups. SIADE SaaS is a spatial decision support system for bus transportation planning and other transportation systems where user destination is unknown. It delivers the most complete and accurate OD matrix in the transport industry using GIS and AFCs data. Our current SW has already attracted the attention of several Transport Operators in 7 countries. We are making a strategic transition from offering consultancy services to software product commercialization on global scale, using a user driven improvement of SIADE based on an incremental methodology.

Q06,19,193380,"Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility: Transportation sector undergoes a considerable transformation as it enters a new landscape where connectivity is seamless and mobility options and related business models are constantly increasing. Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system.

However, due to the lack of maturity of involved key technologies and persisting legal limitations, full automation of on-road driving remains a longer-term vision, particularly in urban environments. The goal and ambition of UP-Drive is to address these technological challenges through the development of an automated valet parking service for city environments, aimed at relieving a car driver from the burden of finding a parking space in city centers. Instead, the fully automated car navigates on its own through urban neighborhoods, finds a parking space and returns on-demand. Creating such a system requires mastering all key technologies essential to automated urban driving beyond the current state-of-the-art: complete round-view perception of the vehicle environment, robust lifelong localization and mapping, sophisticated understanding of complex scenes as well as aggregation and integration of long-term semantic data over a cloud-based infrastructure.

However, security plays a central role: In addition to its classical function in protecting against manipulation and fraud, it also enables novel applications and innovative business models. We propose a research program that leverages binary analysis techniques to improve the security within the IoT. We concentrate on the software level since this enables us to both analyze a given device for potential security vulnerabilities and add security features to harden the device against future attacks. More specifically, we concentrate on the firmware (i.e., the combination of persistent memory together with program code and data that powers such devices) and develop novel mechanism for binary analysis of such software. We design an intermediate language to abstract away from the concrete assembly level and this enables an analysis of many different platforms within a unified analysis framework.

Exploring attacks is fundamental for designing strong countermeasures, analogous to the role of cryptanalysis in cryptology. 2) The development of hardware countermeasures that provide systematic protection against malicious manipulations. In contrast to detection-based methods which dominate the literature, our approach will be pro-active. We will develop solutions for instances of important problems, including hardware reverse engineering and hardware hiding. Little is known about the limits of and optimum approaches to both problems in specific settings. Beyond prevention of hardware Trojans, the research will have applications in"

Despite these opportunities, current information system architectures create obstacles that must be addressed for leveraging the full potential of IoT. One of the most critical obstacles are the ‘vertical silos’ that shape today’s IoT because they constitute a serious impediment to the creation of cross-domain, cross-platform and cross-organisational applications and services. Those silos also hamper developers from producing new added value across multiple platforms due to the lack of interoperability and openness. bIoTope provides the necessary Standardized Open APIs for enabling horizontal interoperability between silos. Such horizontal interoperability makes it possible to develop Systems of Systems where cross-domain information from platforms, devices and other information sources can be accessed when and as needed. bIoTope-enabled Systems can seamlessly exploit all available information, which makes them smart in the sense that they can take or propose the most appropriate actions depending on the current User’s or Object’s Context/Situation, and even learn from experience. bIoTope capabilities lay the foundation for open innovation ecosystems where companies can innovate both by the creation"

They facilitate trustworthy trades and exchanges over the Internet, power cryptocurrencies, ensure transparency for documents, and much more. Although based on cryptographic techniques at their core, the currently deployed DLTs do not address privacy. Indeed, the very idea of a public ledger that stores a verifiable record of transactions at first appears inherently incompatible with the privacy requirements of many potential applications, which use sensitive data such as trade secrets and personal information. New cryptographic techniques and protocols are therefore needed to protect the data, facilitate these applications, and make DLTs deliver on their promises.

The advent of the Internet has been often invoked as a remedy for their democratization. The truth shows a different picture: the digital divide is widening the gap between those who can access and take advantage of the new systems, and those who remain disconnected. The Internet’s unsustainability, coupled with the lack of awareness of the actual complexity of the Internet’s organisation, means that users are mostly unaware of the potentials of digital interaction and, most of all, of the possibility to have a bottom-up, democratic, communal organisation of it. netCommons studies an emerging trend: community-based networking and services that can offer a complement to the global Internet’s model.

It is unlikely that such increase can be tackled by an incremental “more-of-the-same” approach. This proposal stems from the observation that the killer application for wireless networks is on-demand access to Internet content. CARENET advocates a novel content-aware approach to wireless networks design that can provably solve the scalability problem of current systems, thus supporting the paradigmatic shift “from Gigabits per second for a few to Terabytes per month for all”. CARENET’s vision is to serve an arbitrarily large number of users with bounded transmission resources (bandwidth, number of transmit antennas, and power). The fundamental question is: how can such a per-user throughput scalability be achieved in the presence of on-demand requests, for which users do not access simultaneously the same content? CARENET builds on a novel information theoretic formulation of content-aware networks and on several recent results in information theory, network coding, channel coding, and protocol design, stimulated by the PI’s recent work.

New requirements include the need for dynamic changes of the required resources, for example, to react to social events or to shifts of demands. Existing networks and, in particular, the Internet cannot meet those requirements mainly due to their ossification and hence limitation in resource allocation, i.e., lack of flexibility to adapt the available resources to changes of demands on a small time-scale and in an efficient way. In recent years, several concepts have emerged in networking research to provide more flexibility in networks through virtualization and control plane programmability. In particular, the split between data plane and a centralized control plane as defined by Software Defined Networking (SDN) is regarded as the basic concept to allow flexibility in networks. However, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means remains open. In this project, flexibility focuses on the dynamic changes in time and size of a network that is characterized by its resources (link rate and node capacities) and connectivity (network graph).

Q10,21,207032,"Bringing FIWARE to the NEXT step: Digital technologies underpin innovation and competitiveness across a broad range of market sectors. A key technology to boost such innovation and competitiveness is represented by the full and wide adoption of Open Service Platforms. In fact, they will allow increased competition and market penetration because they should be built on top of royalty-free open specifications, adopting open source reference implementations, and s such allowed to be offered by multiple vendors. The Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development (FP7) has developed the FIWARE platform which has demonstrated its potential of becoming a service platform of choice, with proven potential for usage by SMEs and startups. This rises to the extent that four main ICT players in Europe with global ambition have put FIWARE in their strategy for market development. More than that, those four players announced the creation of an open to all legal entity, the FIWARE Foundation, to have more stakeholders driving the evolution of FIWARE. Well in this scope, the aim of the FI-NEXT project is to put in place all the measures necessary in order to make FIWARE materializing such a potential. This will achieved pursuing the following objectives: a) bringing FIWARE from an European Open Source project to a global Open Source Community, b) ensuring FIWARE meets the highest quality standards and best technical support, c) positioning FIWARE as the de facto standard for the"
Q10,22,200038,"Securing Internet Routing from the Ground Up: The Internet is made up of dozens of thousands of smaller networks, called Autonomous Systems (ASes), ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses and schools, e.g., Google, Deutsche Telekom, AT&amp;T, and Hebrew U. Routing between ASes is handled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is the glue that holds the Internet together. Alarmingly, despite the Internet's critical societal and economic role, BGP routing is dangerously vulnerable to configuration errors and attacks, and, consequently, every year or so a major Internet outage makes the news. To remedy BGP’s many security vulnerabilities, researchers and practitioners have invested much effort into designing security solutions for BGP routing. Yet, despite over a decade of Herculean efforts, many technological, political, and economic hurdles hinder, and possibly even prevent, deployment. I argue that the reasons for this are deeply rooted in today’s centralized, top-down, hierarchical paradigm for securing Internet routing. The aim of the planned research project is to put forth and explore a radically new paradigm for securing routing on the Internet. The proposed alternative roadmap for securing the Internet consists of two steps: 1) Jumpstarting BGP security: A novel approach to routing security that"
Q10,23,200732,"Probabilistic Foundations for Networks: In an ever-connected world, increasingly complex network systems play a crucial role in many daily tasks. This results in an acute need for methods/tools that can enable easy control of the network and, at the same time, provide rigorous guarantees about its behavior, performance, and security. Recent years saw the growth of a new software ecosystem -Software-defined networking (SDN)- which advocates a clean and open interface between networking devices and the software that controls them. Yet, existing SDN languages do not support reasoning about crucial quantitative aspects, such as: ""How much congestion is there?"" or ""Is the network resilient under failure?"". Enabling compositional quantitative reasoning is the major breakthrough needed to fully realize the vision of SDN. The central objective of this project is to develop new abstractions for programming of networks, with high-level modular constructs. We will provide rigorous semantic probabilistic foundations, enabling quantitative reasoning. This will serve as a solid platform for program analysis tools where compositional reasoning about complex interactions will be a reality. Our goal will be achieved through an interdisciplinary research effort: using techniques from concurrency and formal methods, areas where akin challenges can be found in the quest to design correct software systems. We will leverage the wealth of recent advances in those areas (some of which from the PI's own research) to network"
Q10,24,212109,"Provably Correct Networks: Networks are the backbone of our society, but configuring them is error-prone and tedious: misconfigured networks result in headline grabbing network outages that affect many users and hurt company revenues while security breaches that endanger millions of customers. There are currently no guarantees that deployed networks correctly implement their operator’s policy. Existing research has focused on two directions: a) low level analysis and instrumentation of real networking code prevents memory bugs in individual network elements, but does not capture network-wide properties desired by operators such as reachability or loop freedom; b) high-level analysis of network-wide properties to verify operator policies on abstract network models; unfortunately, there are no guarantees that the models are an accurate representation of the real network code, and often low-level errors invalidate the conclusions of the high-level analysis. We propose to achieve provably correct networks by simultaneously targeting both low-level security concerns and network-wide policy compliance checking. Our key proposal is to rely on exhaustive network symbolic execution for verification and to automatically generate provably correct implementations from network models. Generating efficient code that is equivalent to the model poses great challenges that we will address with three key contributions: a) We will develop a novel theoretical equivalence framework based on symbolic execution semantics, as well as equivalence-"
Q10,25,212662,"Video streaming services with Software-Defined Networking: Recent advances in mobile devices and video streaming services have motivated large-scale media consumption both in fixed and mobile environments. In this context, the main objective of network operators and service providers is to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users by providing high quality services and mechanisms for seamless adaptation to the specific network conditions of each user. However, the initial design of the Internet as a best-effort network makes it inappropriate for high-volume and bandwidth-intensive applications, like video streaming, and the centralised architectures employed by the network operators lead to long, non-optimal communication paths between clients and servers, waste of network resources and increased delays. The improvement of the QoE of multimedia communication services require novel network architectures and cross-layer adaptation mechanisms. Specifically, at the network layer, Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables the virtualisation of the network functions so that the network operators implement their own rules and policies in software and deploy them in an abstracted and virtualised network infrastructure. At the application layer, the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) approach enables the seamless adaptation of the video client to the specific network conditions of each user. The understanding of how the network parameters affect the human perception is a key factor in optimizing the functions in"
Q10,26,193612,"Distributed Optimization Methods for Smart Cyber-Physical Networks: The combination of embedded electronics and communication capability in almost any mobile or portable device has turned this century into the age of cyber-physical networks. Smart communicating devices with their sensing, computing and control capabilities promise to make our cities, transportation systems, factories and living environments more intelligent, energy-efficient, safe and secure. This extremely complex system has raised a number of new challenges involving ICT disciplines. In particular, a novel peer-to-peer distributed computational model is appearing as a new opportunity in which a service is built-up cooperatively by peers, rather than by a unique provider that knows and owns all data. The interdisciplinary “Optimization Community” is facing this revolution sharing a common need: to find new theories, methodologies and tools to optimize over this complex network system. With this in mind, OPT4SMART has a twofold objective. First, to provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to solve distributed optimization problems over peer-to-peer networks. Second, to develop effective numerical tools, based on this framework, to solve estimation, learning, decision and control problems in cyber-physical networks. To achieve this twofold objective, we will take a systems-theory perspective. Specific problems from these four areas will be abstracted to a common mathematical set-up"
Q10,27,202926,"Traditional Organised Crime and the Internet: The changing organization of illegal gambling networks: Transnational criminal networks utilise Information Communication Technology (ICT) to commit ‘old’ and ‘new’ types of crime. ICT assists in transnational crime (i.e., hacking) and also as a way to exchange information or plan new crimes. Empirical research has provided ample evidence that social and familial networks play a crucial role in the formation and growth (recruitment) of criminal networks. However, ICT now makes it possible for organised crime to form networks without the restrictions of geographic proximity and with the growth in the online gambling sector estimated at 13 billion Euros per annum in the EU worth approximately 15 percent of EU gambling market such sums of revenue attracts unwanted attention from organised cybercriminals. This proposal will therefore examine online gambling and extortion networks. The reason(s) for this is that gambling – illegal and legal – has often attracted organised crime, and empirical evidence regarding online gambling and extortion in EU is limited. The objectives of this research are: establish tools and technique that facilitate management of internal/external cyber-threats to online gambling sector validate tools and techniques that will facilitate the management of internal/external cyber-threats to online gambling sector set standards of information management set standards of dissemination and flows of information to cybersecurity centres from online gambling sector in EU This is to be"
Q10,28,194235,"Business and IT-Cloud Alignment using a Smart Socket: Business and IT Alignment is important challenge, as we are facing a dramatic change in the way we rely, depend and interact with ICT that influences our everyday life. Although “digital natives” will soon enter the workforce, there is still a huge gap between the business domain and ICT domain in terms of awareness, common understanding or expertise. This hampers the take-off of technology such as Cloud Computing. Hence, we are facing a competition, between global-market players who quicker succeed in changing business into the Cloud to raise ICT efficiency and reduce costs. This is particularly true for SMEs that have started to embrace virtualisation or at best IaaS offers but the exploding and dynamic market of components available on the PaaS or SaaS level demands for expertise and time typically not available at SMEs. Business processes are commodity when defining business activities in human understandable way in form of “sequences of manual, semi-automatic or automated tasks with the aim to achieve the company’s goal”. Previous work in plugIT mapped business processes on static ICT configurations available at a company’s site, assuming ICT is still mainly configured on platform or component level. CloudSocket envisions the idea of “Business Process as a Service”, where domain-specific business processes like employee registration at social insurance, tax report, or legal verification are supported by"
Q10,29,209977,"Public Administration and Technology: Digital technologies are in the centre of the ongoing industrial revolution that is bound to change not only markets, but also societies and governments. Central to these developments is the evolution of public sector technological capacities, that is, an ability of public organizations to explore, develop and/or adapt new technological solutions in public service design, delivery and evaluation. One of the central questions that has so far fallen in between different research strands is how technology affects the evolution of work organization and administrative capacities in public sector. In the context of increasing dependence on technological developments, and thus, related opportunities as well as uncertainties and risks, the conventional public administration accounts fall short in fully grasping the influence of technology on public sector change. The research objectives of the project are to: a) develop a coherent and novel conceptual framework on public sector technological capacities and provide novel and empirically grounded explanations on the co-evolutionary development mechanisms of public organizations and technology through comparative cross-country analysis. In order to map and understand different co-evolutionary patterns, the project will use a comparative approach by studying two different fields (with high and low/moderate level of technological complexity) in two different small states (in an advanced (Belgium) and less advanced (Estonia) socio-economic contexts)."
Q10,30,194310,"Trustful hyper-linked entities in dynamic networks: The Internet (r)evolution has changed traditional business and forces it to reinvent itself. Traditional operator-enabled services are losing on their importance due to a variety of new communication services, like chat and social networks, which complement or supersede traditional ones like voice telephony. Technical progress has minimized the need for access-controlled communication services and is moving instead to context based communication, which is presumably available at only marginal or no additional cost. However, unlike traditional telecommunication services, that enable universal communication, Internet communication tools are characterized by their walled garden approach, where users can only communicate with users of the same application and are not free to change application without losing their data or contacts. The main goal of the reTHINK project is to design and prototype a new, non telecom centric, but Web-centric P2P Service Architecture enabling dynamic trusted relationships among distributed applications called Hyperlinked Entities that support use-cases such as contextual and social communications, M2M/IoT and content oriented services. This project will enable any type of service delivery through specialized end-to-end network quality commitments, powered by specialized P2P and/or Cloud services (delivered as SaaS,PaaS or IaaS). The major structural difference between the operators approach and the web companies is related to a re"
